## 📖 About This Repository

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Journey**! 🌟

This repository serves as a **knowledge base and experimental laboratory** for my machine learning studies. Unlike my end-to-end deployment projects, this collection focuses purely on:
* **Core Algorithms:** Implementation and fine-tuning of ML models.
* **Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering techniques.
* **Experimentation:** Testing different approaches to solve classic data science problems.

It contains individual notebooks and scripts categorized by learning topics, serving as a cookbook for various ML techniques.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The projects are organized by the type of machine learning problem:

### 📈 1. Regression (Predicting Continuous Values)
Experiments focused on predicting numerical outcomes using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
* **🚗 Car Price Prediction:** Predicting the selling price of used cars based on features like year, km driven, and fuel type.
* **🚖 NYC Taxi Trip Duration:** Forecasting the duration of taxi trips in New York City to optimize logistics.
* **📦 Retail Store Inventory Forecasting:** Predicting future sales and inventory requirements.

### 🎯 2. Classification (Predicting Categories)
Projects involving binary and multi-class classification problems.
* **💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection:** Identifying fraudulent transactions in highly imbalanced datasets.
* **📉 Customer Churn Prediction:** Analyzing customer behavior to predict likely churners in the telecom industry.
* **🔢 Handwritten Digit Prediction:** Using KNN to recognize and classify handwritten digits (MNIST-style).

### 🛍️ 3. Recommender Systems & Unsupervised Learning
Exploring clustering and recommendation engines.
* **💄 Beauty Product Recommendation:** A collaborative filtering system (KNN with Means) to suggest beauty products.
* **👥 Customer Segmentation (K-Means):** Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior for targeted marketing.
